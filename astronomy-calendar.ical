DESCRIPTION:The Quadrantids is an above average shower\, with up to 40 met
 eors per hour at its peak. It is thought to be produced by dust grains lef
 t behind by an extinct comet known as 2003 EH1\, which was discovered in 2
 003. The shower runs annually from January 1-5. It peaks this year on the 
 night of the 3rd and  morning of the 4th.  Unfortunately the nearly full m
 oon will block out all but the brightest meteors this year. Best viewing w
 ill be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the 
 constellation Bootes\, but can appear anywhere in the sky.

DESCRIPTION:The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10
  meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P 
 Giacobini-Zinner\, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an
  unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead o
 f early morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from Oct
 ober 6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. The first quart
 er moon will block the fainter meteors in the early evening. It will set s
 hortly after midnight leaving darker skies for observing any lingering str
 agglers. Best viewing will be in the early evening from a dark location fa
 r away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Draco
 \, but can appear anywhere in the sky.

DESCRIPTION:The Eta Aquarids is an above average shower\, capable of produ
 cing up to 60 meteors per hour at its peak. Most of the activity is seen i
 n the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere\, the rate can reach
  about 30 meteors per hour. It is produced by dust particles left behind b
 y comet Halley\, which has known and observed since ancient times. The sho
 wer runs annually from April 19 to May 28. It peaks this year on the night
  of May 6 and the morning of the May 7. The waxing gibbous moon will block
  out many of the fainter meteors this year. But if you are patient\, you s
 hould be able to catch quite a few of the brighter ones. Best viewing will
  be from a dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the con
 stellation Aquarius\, but can appear anywhere in the sky.

 at 15:47 UTC. This full moon was known by early Native American tribes as 
 the Full Cold Moon because this is the time of year when the cold winter a

  known as the Full Long Nights Moon and the Moon Before Yule. This is also

DESCRIPTION:The Geminids is the  king of the meteor showers. It is conside
 red by many to be the best shower in the heavens\, producing up to 120 mul
 ticolored meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behi
 nd by an asteroid known as 3200 Phaethon\, which was discovered in 1982. T
 he shower runs annually from December 7-17. It peaks this year on the nigh
 t of the 13th and morning of the 14th. The waning crescent moon will be no
  match for the Geminids this year. The skies should still be dark enough f
 or an excellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midn

  20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind by 
 comets Marsden and Kracht. The shower runs annually from July 12 to August
  23. It peaks this year on the night of July 28 and morning of July 29. Th
 e nearly full moon will be a problem this year\, blocking out all but the 
 brightest meteors. But if you are patient\, you should still be able to ca
 tch a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midni

DESCRIPTION:The Delta Aquarids is an average shower that can produce up to
  20 meteors per hour at its peak. It is produced by debris left behind by 
 comets Marsden and Kracht. The shower runs annually from July 12 to August
  23. It peaks this year on the night of July 28 and morning of July 29. Th
 e nearly full moon will be a problem this year. It's glare will block bloc
 k most of the faintest meteors. But if you are patient\, you should still 
 be able to catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be from a dark locatio
 n after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Aquarius\, b
 ut can appear anywhere in the sky.

 his is the third of four full moons in this season\, it is known as a blue
  moon. This rare calendar event only happens once every few years\, giving
  rise to the term\, “once in a blue moon.” There are normally only thr
 ee full moons in each season of the year. But since full moons occur every
  29.53 days\, occasionally a season will contain 4 full moons. The extra 
 full moon of the season is known as a blue moon. Blue moons occur on avera

  about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That
  last of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains le
 ft behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1865. The showe
 r runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the
  17th and morning of the 18th. This should be an excellent year for the Le
 onids. The thin\, crescent moon won't be much of a problem and skies will 
 be dark enough for what should be an great show. Best viewing will be from

 comets Marsden and Kracht. The shower runs annually from July 12 to August

 fortunately the full moon will obscure most of the meteors this year. But 
 if you are patient\, you may still be able to catch a few of the brighter 
 ones. Meteors will radiate from the constellation Aquarius\, but can appea

 of the 22nd and morning of the 23rd. These meteors can sometimes produce b
 right dust trails that last for several seconds.  This is an excellent yea

  an excellent show. Best viewing will be from a dark location after midnig

  of May 6 and the morning of the May 7. Unfortunately the nearly full moon
  will block out most of the fainter meteors this year. But if you are pati

DESCRIPTION:The Leonids is an average shower\, producing up to 15 meteors 
 per hour at its peak. This shower is unique in that it has a cyclonic peak
  about every 33 years where hundreds of meteors per hour can be seen. That
  last of these occurred in 2001. The Leonids is produced by dust grains le
 ft behind by comet Tempel-Tuttle\, which was discovered in 1865. The showe
 r runs annually from November 6-30. It peaks this year on the night of the
  17th and morning of the 18th. This should be an excellent year for the Le
 onids. The thin\, crescent moon will set early in the evening leaving dark
  enough for what should be an excellent show. Best viewing will be from a 
 dark location after midnight. Meteors will radiate from the constellation 
 Leo\, but can appear anywhere in the sky.

DESCRIPTION:The Ursids is a minor meteor shower producing about 5-10 meteo
 rs per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet Tuttle\, w
 hich was first discovered in 1790. The shower runs annually from December 
 17-25. It peaks this year on the the night of the 21st and morning of the 
 22nd. Unfortunately the nearly full moon will block most of the fainter me
 teors this year. But if you are really patient\, you may still be able to 
 catch a few good ones. Best viewing will be just after midnight from a dar
 k location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate from the conste

DESCRIPTION:The September equinox occurs at 23:27 UTC. The Sun will shine 
 directly on the equator and there will be nearly equal amounts of day and 
 night throughout the world. This is also the first day of fall (autumnal e
 quinox) in the Northern Hemisphere and the first day of spring (vernal equ
 inox) in the Southern Hemisphere.

DESCRIPTION:The Draconids is a minor meteor shower producing only about 10
  meteors per hour. It is produced by dust grains left behind by comet 21P 
 Giacobini-Zinner\, which was first discovered in 1900. The Draconids is an
  unusual shower in that the best viewing is in the early evening instead o
 f early morning like most other showers. The shower runs annually from Oct
 ober 6-10 and peaks this year on the the night of the 7th. Unfortunately t
 he glare from the nearly full moon will block most of the meteors this yea
 r. Combined with the low hourly rate it would probably be best to skip thi
 s one unless you are really patient. Best viewing will be in the early eve
 ning from a dark location far away from city lights. Meteors will radiate 
 from the constellation Draco\, but can appear anywhere in the sky.

 t 2P Encke. The shower runs annually from September 7 to December 10. It p
 eaks this year on the the night of November 4. The waxing gibbous moon wil
 l block most of the fainter meteors in the evening. But it will set a few 
 hours after midnight leaving dark skies for what could be a good early mor
